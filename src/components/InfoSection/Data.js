  description:
    "Lambda Phi Epsilon was formed on February 25, 1981 at the University of California, Los Angeles. Noting that Asian fraternities and sororities at the University of California campuses were recognized only as service organizations due to their membership's focus on specific Asian groups and exclusion of other ethnic groups, the founders aimed to create a fraternity that transcends the traditional boundaries of national origins, bridges the gaps between those communities, and is recognized by the Greek community at large. While the original charter focused on Asian Pacific Americans, people from all ethnic backgrounds were welcome to join.",

David was soon joined by Jimmy Chen, Alex Choi, Rigel Trajano, Craig Puntel, Can Hu, and James Dungca.",
